Power8 FRU VPD Example:
======================

p8/memcard1_ddr3:    This is an example of a VPD template for a DDR3 memory riser
                  card with a single memory buffer(Centaur).

p8/memcard4_ddr3:    This is an example of a VPD template for a DDR3 memory riser
                  card with 2 to 4 memory buffer (Centaurs).

p8/memcard1_ddr4:    This is an example of a VPD template for a DDR4 memory riser
                  card with a single memory buffer(Centaur).

p8/memcard4_ddr4:    This is an example of a VPD template for a DDR4 memory riser
                  card with 2 to 4 memory buffer (Centaurs).

p8/sysplanar:        This is an example of a VPD template for an OpenPower system
                  planar (aka mother board) that does not have any memory
                  buffer on the card.  A memory riser card will be plugged
                  onto this system planar.

p8/sysplanar32_ddr3: This is an example of a VPD template for an OpenPower system
                  planar (aka mother board) that has upto 32 memory buffers
                  (Centaurs) on the card.  DDR3 ISDIMMs are plugged onto this
                  system planar.                 

p8/sysplanar32_ddr4: This is an example of a VPD template for an OpenPower system
                  planar (aka mother board) that has upto 32 memory buffers
                  (Centaurs) on the card.   DDR3 ISDIMMs are plugged onto this
                  system planar.

Power9 FRU VPD Example:
======================
p9/sysplanar32_ddr4: This is an example of a VPD template for an OpenPower P9 system
                  planar (aka mother board) that has DDR4 ISDIMMs direct attach to
                  the processor on the same card that the ISDIMM are plugged onto.


Axone FRU VPD Example:
=====================
p9a/sysplanar:    This is an example of a system planar FRU VPD template for a system
                  with the next generation IBM POWER chip, Axone.

p9a/openbmc:      This is an example of an OpenBMC FRU VPD template for a system with
                  Axone processor

p9a/genericfru    This is an example of a generic FRU VPD template for a system with 
                  Axone processor

p9a/powerfru      This is an example of a power, power supply or VRM card, FRU VPD 
                  template for a system with Axone processor.

Syntax Examples
===============
bindatainput:     Shows the syntax to have a binary input file for the keyword
                  data

hexwithcomments:  Shows inclusion of comments within hex data for easier reading

rbinfile:         Shows how to include a binary file that contains an entire
                  record.  Can be created using the -r option on createVpd.py

simple:           Most basic syntax example

tworecords:       Shows how to define multiple records within one top level
                  input file
